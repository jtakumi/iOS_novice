# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the iOS_novice app from loading landmark data from static JSON files to managing landmark data internally within the app using SwiftData. This will provide better data management capabilities, improved performance, and the foundation for future features like data synchronization and dynamic content updates.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to load landmark data from internal storage instead of JSON files, so that the app has better performance and data management capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL load landmark data from SwiftData storage instead of JSON files
2. WHEN landmark data is accessed THEN the system SHALL retrieve it from the internal database with the same performance or better than JSON loading
3. WHEN the app displays landmarks THEN the system SHALL show the same landmark information that was previously loaded from JSON files

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate existing JSON data to SwiftData models, so that no landmark data is lost during the transition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is updated THEN the system SHALL automatically migrate all existing landmark data from JSON files to SwiftData storage
2. WHEN migration occurs THEN the system SHALL preserve all landmark properties including name, description, location coordinates, image references, and localized content
3. WHEN migration is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing multi-language support (English, Japanese, Indonesian)
4. IF migration fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback to JSON loading and log appropriate error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to continue supporting all existing functionality, so that the data migration is transparent to me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the landmark list THEN the system SHALL display all landmarks with the same filtering and search capabilities
2. WHEN viewing landmark details THEN the system SHALL show all information including maps, images, and descriptions
3. WHEN managing favorites THEN the system SHALL continue to work with the same persistence and functionality
4. WHEN switching languages THEN the system SHALL display localized content from the internal storage

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean data architecture, so that future enhancements to data management are easier to implement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the new data layer THEN the system SHALL use SwiftData models that follow the existing Landmark structure
2. WHEN accessing data THEN the system SHALL use a repository pattern that abstracts data source details from the UI layer
3. WHEN the data layer is implemented THEN the system SHALL maintain separation of concerns between data models and view models
4. WHEN future data features are needed THEN the system SHALL provide a foundation that supports data synchronization and dynamic updates

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to handle data loading errors gracefully, so that the app remains stable and usable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data loading fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages to the user
2. WHEN SwiftData is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide fallback mechanisms to ensure app functionality
3. WHEN data corruption occurs THEN the system SHALL attempt recovery and provide user feedback
4. WHEN network or storage issues arise THEN the system SHALL handle errors without crashing the app
